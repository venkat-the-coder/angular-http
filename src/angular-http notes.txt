topics learned 
1. rest api
2. http client module
3. http client
4. mainting the data handling in seperate service 
5. different http action verbs
6. how to pass values into each action verbs
7. each action verb has return type post<T> to get the response
8. each service method will return the observable observable<T>
9. each servie method response can be transaformed into another form via pipes and rxja operators
10. we need to subcribe the obseravable in component or whereever using the service method
11. we can pass three different call back in subscribe one is success ,error and completion 


Advanced HTTP request and error handling

Error Handling:
using catch error

resolvers:
Resolvers are used to fetch data before routing to another route
resolvers will fetch the data then only it will activate the next route
its needs to be configured in routing module and retrived as snapshot data in component


Interceptors

1. they are used to manipulate the request before sending to the server
2. and also manipulate the same before receiving from the server
3. it actually implements the http interceptor interface like resolve ,canactivate

why using interceptor?

1. adding specific headers to all the request irresepctive of what type it is
2. logging the errors or any kind of informations
3. reporting progress events
4. client side caching
